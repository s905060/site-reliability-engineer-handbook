# Setup SSH Passwordless Login in OpenSSHYou can login to a remote Linux server without entering password in 3 simple steps using ssky-keygen and ssh-copy-id as explained in this example.ssh-keygen creates the public and private keys. ssh-copy-id copies the local-host’s public key to the remote-host’s authorized_keys file. ssh- copy-id also assigns proper permission to the remote-host’s home, ~/.ssh, and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.Step 1: Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host```jsmith@local-host$ ssh-keygenGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key(/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa):[Enter key]Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enterkey]Enter same passphrase again: [Pess enter key]Your identification has been saved in/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.The key fingerprint is:33:b3:fe:af:95:95:18:11:31:d5:de:96:2f:f2:35:f9jsmith@local-host```Step 2: Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh- copy-id```jsmith@local-host$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pubremote-hostjsmith@remote-host’s password:Now try logging into the machine, with “ssh ‘remote-host’”, and check in:.ssh/authorized_keys to make sure we haven’t added extrakeys that you weren’t expecting.```Note: ssh-copy-id appends the keys to the remote-host’s .ssh/authorized_key.Step 3: Login to remote-host without entering the password```jsmith@local-host$ ssh remote-host Last login: Sun Nov 16 17:22:33 2008 from 192.168.1.2[Note: SSH did not ask for password.] jsmith@remote-host$ [Note: You are on remote-host here]```
