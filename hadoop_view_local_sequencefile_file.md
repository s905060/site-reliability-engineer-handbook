Download from HDFS will sequencefile not view the local post. In fact hadoop command type supported operating the local file system.

Check local sequencefile file as follows:

`hadoop FS - Dfs . default . name = File : /// Sequence file -text local path`

On HDFS can look directly -text

`hadoop FS   - Sequence text file on the local path`
